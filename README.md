# HellwettPackardPrinterDrivers-MacOS-
Pre-patched HP printer driver installer with the macOS version restriction removed. 
The original driver binaries are unchanged; only the installer Distribution script was modified to bypass the macOS ≤15 check so the package can install on newer macOS versions.

Provided for educational and compatibility testing purposes.
